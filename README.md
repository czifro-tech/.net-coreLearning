# .net-coreLearning
I am learning the new .net core MVC6 EF7.

The starting point for this app will be a blank asp .net core web app. I wanted to build this app from the ground up because this is just a proof of concept app for learning... When I am more familiar with .net core I will start using the starting templates.
