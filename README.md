# Building .NET Core From the Ground Up
Building .NET Core MVC6 EF7 From the Ground Up.

The starting point for this app will be a blank asp .net core web app. I wanted to build this app from the ground up because this is just a proof of concept app for learning... When I am more familiar with .net core I will start using the starting templates.
